# Bike Share Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes bike share data to uncover insights about usage patterns, station popularity, and bike type preferences. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the bike share system is used by its customers.

## Aim
The main objectives of this project are:
- To identify the most popular bike stations.
- To determine the maximum and minimum trip durations from the start stations.
- To analyze the distribution of bike types (classic bikes and e-bikes).

## Scope
The scope of this project includes:
- Analyzing the bike share data to extract meaningful insights.
- Creating visualizations to represent the data findings.
- Providing a clear methodology for replicating the analysis.
